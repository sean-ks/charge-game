<h1 align="center">Charge: A Filipino Turn-based game</h1>
Charge is a turn-based filipino hand game from the 2000s. Each turn, players get to choose between three types of actions:  
  1. Charge - If you play a charge, you're granted an additional charge used to play more weapons or blocks. However, playing a charge leaves you vulnerable to attacks  
  2. Weapons/Attacks - With the exception of the Knife, Weapons generally cost at least some charge:  
    2a. Knife - Requires 0 charges but has a limit of 2 uses per round, deals half damage, can go through block and reflect but not counter  
    2b. Pistol/Bang - Requires 1 charge, deals 1 damage, can't break block or reflect  
  3. Defense - These defend against attacks, only stronger versions require charge:  
    3a. Counter - Requires 0 charges, only deflects against knife, useless against anything else  
    3b. Reflect - Requires 0 charges, reflects against projectiles  
    3c. Block - requires 0 charges, blocks against projectiles  
After the turn, if there's at least two players still alive, the game continues until there's one person left (the winner) or no one's left alive (draw)
